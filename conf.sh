CHIM XTTS

This will install CHIM XTTS. This is a high quality TTS service that works with Skyrim voices. 
You can also generate your own voices.
However it will require around 4GB of VRAM! 

Options:
* deepseed = Uses more VRAM but faster
* lowvram = Uses less VRAM but slower
* regular = Middle ground of both options above

If you are not sure use lowvram.
